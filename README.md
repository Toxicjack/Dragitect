🚀 **What is Dragitect?**  
Dragitect is a **drag-and-drop software** that lets you **create your own Python programs visually** without writing code manually.  

🔹 If you **don’t know how to code** but want to create logic in Python, Dragitect helps you do it **your own way**.  
🔹 You can **drag blocks, connect them, and create working Python scripts** without typing any code.  
🔹 The **simulation mode** lets you see **how your program runs step by step**.  
🔹 The **package inspector** shows **which Python packages your program is using**.
